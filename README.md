# Capstone 1 - Population growth by zip code

### The goal of this project is to examine two datasets of census data, and generate evidence supporting or debunking validity. This project will entail reading in census data in .csv files, manipulating/cleaning the data for ease of viewing and correcting null values, joining multiple sets of values to display trends, and outputing visuals to represent findings.

### requirements pandas, matplotlib, python 3.10.10

### 1. Read data in. 
    Read in data from a local csv, excel file, json, or any other file type.
    Two csv files read in with pandas.

### 2. Manipulate and clean your data.
    Use custom functions or lambdas to perform specific operations to clean or manipulate your data, return those values, 
    then use them in other parts of your project.
    Datasets joined, reindexed, null values in two columns filled.

### 3. Analyze your data!
    Write custom functions to operate on your data.
    Explored/compared averages, sums, value counts of multiple data points by columns and groups.
    
### 4. Visualize your data.
    Make 2 basic plots with matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
    Utilized pandas and matplotlib to generate pie charts, bar charts and a scatterplot.
    
### 5. Interpret your data and graphical output. If your project is in a Jupyter Notebook, this should be between the important cells.
    Write markdown cells in Jupyter explaining your thought process and code. If you make a few plots with matplotlib, 
    explain what the reader is seeing and why you chose to plot things that way.
