### The goal of this project is to import, view and manipulate census data from .csv files.

### requirements pandas, matplotlib

### 1. Read data in. 
    Read in data from a local csv, excel file, json, or any other file type.

### 2. Manipulate and clean your data.
    Use custom functions or lambdas to perform specific operations to clean or manipulate your data, return those values, 
    then use them in other parts of your project.

### 3. Analyze your data!
    Write custom functions to operate on your data.
    
### 4. Visualize your data.
    Make 2 basic plots with matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
    
### 5. Interpret your data and graphical output. If your project is in a Jupyter Notebook, this should be between the important cells.
    Write markdown cells in Jupyter explaining your thought process and code. If you make a few plots with matplotlib, 
    explain what the reader is seeing and why you chose to plot things that way.
